                <h1>"BROWN BEARS"</h1>
                <p>
                    The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear species found across Eurasia and North America. In North America, the populations of brown bears are called grizzly bears. 
                    It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less variable in size and slightly bigger on average. 
                    The brown bear's range includes parts of Russia, Central Asia, China, Canada, the United States, Hokkaido, Scandinavia, the Balkans, the Picos de Europa and the Carpathian region (especially Romania and Bulgaria), Iran, Anatolia, and the Caucasus. 
                    The brown bear is recognized as a national and state animal in several European countries.

                <h1>"PENGUINS"</h1>
                <p>
                    Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Gal√°pagos penguin, found north of the equator.
                    Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming.
                    Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch while swimming underwater. They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea.

                <h1>"PSCYHOLOGY"</h1>
                <p>
                    Psychology is the science of mind and behavior. Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena, as well as feeling and thought.
                    It is an academic discipline of immense scope. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, 
                    and all the variety of phenomena linked to those emergent properties, joining this way the broader neuro-scientific group of researchers.
                    As a social science, it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases.
